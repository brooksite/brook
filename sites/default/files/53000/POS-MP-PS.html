Perry's ceremony on May 12 to bury his ashes and pay tribute to a wonderful person was really nice.  It was a beautiful spot - Arvada cemetery is set on a ridge with at least 180 degree view if not more,
looking west to the mountains.  His gravesite is in the shade of a small crabapple tree - just really beautiful spot.  (Tree had bloomed earlier - so ... but can't always get Nature to cooperate.)  
<P>
Fran encouraged several of us to place flowers one by one onto the box, which had been wrapped in a beautiful yellow silk scarf from Thailand and placed in the ground. Each person placing flowers said 
the name of one or more out of towner or other who could not make it.  So, all the cousins and Rho and my folks were honorably mentioned, so to speak, and thus were there in spirit and in ritual.  
<P>
Pauline Loos had sent a jar of Found Lake water - Fran had me pour it on the box wrapped in the scarf - she said just soak it - "Perry would love the immersion in Found Lake water" - hard to argue with that - 
he really would love it - so that's what we did.  
<P>
Their Unitarian minister said some very nice words of rememberance, and we had a moment of silence to remember and pay respects to him.  They had put a couple pictures of Perry around - one of him in 
say his 60s, and one from his mid-40s.  The weather was nice - springlike you could say - it produced a good feeling reflecting a time of renewal.  It was as the minister said "a celebration of his life and spirit".
<P>
In attendance - Gay (Brook) and Chuck Rohrer, Konnie, Jody and I, Jessica and her family (Dan and Peter and Alexander), and of course, Conrad and Fran.  
<br>Conrad took some photos, so we may have those to share soon.

Dear Family...<br>
 <br>
    A little birdy urged me to share this with us all.   As is the case with most of us I am unable to attend Perry's memorial gathering today in Arvada..<br>
    In lieu thereof I have written up a small remembrance... though not intended to be a poem I guess I couldn't help but rhyme sometimes from line to line..<br>  
    So if you'd look past some of the rough and  maybe slightly corny style... I'd be happy to share... as always... it's the thought that counts....<br>
<P> <br>

Oh Perry... youngest of three brothers<br>.
A gentle man I knew... though not as well as the others.<br>
Dashing and handsome I always thought... in photos of old...<br>
whether in uniform, or kilt or any attire you wore.<br>

Oh Perry... the youngest of three<br>
And closest to my mother were thee.<br>
You chased her and teased her and always a friend you pleased her.<br>
A man of noble calling, a doctor, a healer, a true concern for the publics well being.<br>

Oh Perry O.   How I remembered when asked<br>
You said the name 'Orlo' you gave to the cat.<br>
You were just Perry... that's who you wanted to be.<br>
But now it seems that cat has given 'Orlo' back to ye.<br>

Oh Perry oh... your twinkling eyes... your smile...<br>
and soft voice is the Perry I know.<br>
As time goes on by... you'll be there... still a part of me.<br>
I'm thankful you were family and there in our lives.<br>

On this spring day's remembrance... in this season of rebirth.<br>
