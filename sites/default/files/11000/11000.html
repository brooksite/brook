<CENTER><BIG><B><U>The MYSTERY OF JANET E. BROOK</U></B></BIG></CENTER>

<P>

I did a search for my grandfather, Harley McSpadden (HB1), and I found that his first child, Janet, was listed as residing with her family on the 25th of 
April 1910 USA Census for Saginaw City, MI.  I also did a search in her name as well, and also found out that on the 16th of April 1910, Janet E. Brook was 
listed as an inmate at the <b>Michigan Home for the Feeble-Minded &amp; Epileptic</b> (I have provided more information on this facility at the end) in 
Lapeer, MI.  In both US Censuses, she was listed as a 7 years old white female born in Iowa, with father born in Minnesota, and mother born in Wisconsin. 
The census from Lapeer, MI, further states that she does not speak English.<p>

This, in my mind anyway, explains why so little is known about her, as one was ashamed and quiet about this subject back then.<P>

At this point, I have the following <b>(click on the icons to see readable images):</b>

<b>My questions to anyone who can help:</b>
  <P>
<ul>
  <li>How did HB1 meet Jennie?  <br />They only lived about 20 mi apart.
  <P>
  <li>At the time of marriage, HB1 was working in the Waukesha school system. <br />Did he live in Waukesha before marrying, and If so, for how long?
  <P>
  <li>Why did HB1 and Jennie get married in Ludington, MI?  <br />That's way across Lake Michigan by ship, or 343 miles by car.  <br>Has anyone seen any wedding pictures?
  <P>
  <li>Was Janet really born in Davenport, Scott Co., Iowa?<br />Did they move there &amp; if so, when and how long did they stay?  <br>Has anyone seen any pictures of Janet, or of their stay in Iowa?
  <P>
  <li>Is Janet's birth date correct?<br />If it is correct, she was born 10 months after HB1 & JAK were married.<br />If so, Janet was still six years old and not seven, when both 1910 census were taken.
  <P>
  <li>When did they move to Saginaw, MI?  <br />When did they leave?
  <P>

</ul>
<b>What may have happened:</b>
  <P>
My novel based on the facts I've found out and what I know about my grandfather personally and from others (God love him, it‘s in our blood), is as follows:
  <P>
<i>
Harley McSpadden Brook met Jennie Agnes Kimball when he got his job in Waukesha or maybe on trips she made to the big city.  Possibly her dad knew JJB and that is how they met.
</i>
  <P>
<i>
They started dating and did what young people have always done.  He got her pregnant and, as both fathers were important men, they arranged for the marriage to be a long way from home in order to keep the gossip down.  Alternately, they could have just eloped, not wanting to wait for wedding preparations.  I have never seen any wedding pictures, nor any others in Davenport, IA or Saginaw, MI.
</i>
  <P>
<i>
As they got married over the summer, HB1 probably had school vacation and they went to visit some shirt-tail relatives in Iowa for their honeymoon, or maybe HB1 got a teaching job out there.  Someone told me that HB1 was the IOWA State Director of Vocational Schools.  Can anyone verify this?   They then stayed to have the baby, and gave an appropriate date for the birth of Janet and their marriage.
</i>
  <P>
<i>
Meanwhile, back in Milwaukee, JJB was pulling strings to find a good job for HB1, when he received the news that Janet was not normal.   Now his job was tougher, as he was looking to get his son a job near a facility for his grandchild, if needed.  Finally, one was found in Saginaw, MI, which was also close to a "state of the art" institution in Lapeer, MI.  </i>
  <P>
<i>
Timing for this move was critical, as Jennie was already pregnant with KMB.  He was born in Saginaw, just 9-1/2 months after Janet.  They managed to care for Janet until she was about 7, when she finally was accepted into the Lapeer institution (see MI statue below).  She probably lived there until she died, probably sometime after ABB was born in Saginaw on 29 Apr 1912.  
</i>
  <P>
 I don't think HB1 and JAK would have left Janet there alone, while they moved to  Minneapolis where HB2 was born on 04 Dec 1913.  So my best guess for Janet's death would be late winter of 1912 or spring of 1913, so the move to Minneapolis could be made in the summer of 1913, in time for HB1's new school position and for the  birth of HB2.

<b><u>Footnote:</u></b>
  <P>
Niles told me that Kim asked his father "Why did you and mommy get married?', and HB1 responded "Well, your mother and I were sitting on the porch swing when your mother leaned over and wispered something in my ear - so we got married".  He also told me that they met at a reformatory school in Waukesha, where they were both teachers.

<b><u>Some data on the "Michigan Home for the Feeble Minded and Epileptic"</u></b>
  <P>
The Lapeer State Home — with 1,060 employees once Lapeer’s largest employer — was closed in October 1992 and demolished in 1996. Thirteen copulas, which once rested atop two brick dormitory buildings, were salvaged from the demolition and are today part of the city's new logo, and the centerpiece of the new gateways, leading to downtown.

<center><img src="MI home for Feeble-minded.jpg" width="544" height="195" alt="Home for Feeb;e-minded" /></center>
  <P>
Many people who were classified as "feeble-minded" would now be seen as having learning disabilities, social or psychological problems, or as being merely the victims of poverty and racism.
  <P>
The social philosophy at that time was to provide a "home" for individuals who were not mentally capable of coping with life in the community or were epileptic. Then Governor John T. Rich, who secured the "home" for the Lapeer area, (he was from Lapeer) gave the following address in his "Messages of Governor of Michigan." He advised that the state
facility in Lapeer "could not receive inmates until appropriations for furnishings were made. It they were made early, it would be ready for occupancy sometime in March of 1895. The present buildings consist of two cottages, capable of accommodating 100 patients each. From present indications some additional accommodations will be necessary, independent of the provisions for the epileptics now confined in several asylums for the insane." The Michigan Home for the Feeble Minded and Epileptics opened in August of 1895 and closed
October 1st, 1991.
  <P>
According to David Trudge, the last administrator, during those years it grew to accommodate a population as high as 4,500 inmates and 1,450 staff. The name of the "home" would change during the years. It began as the "Michigan Home for the Feeble Minded and Epileptic. In 1913 it was renamed the Michigan Home and Training School In 1937 it became the Lapeer State Home and Training School. Finally it was called the Oakdale Regional Center for Developmental Disabilities. For over ninety-six years, it was a major source of income for many families in and around the Lapeer area

<b><u>MI Institutionalization Act 1893</u></b>
  <P>
1893 Milch. Pub. Acts 412: AN ACT to establish a home and training school for the feeble-minded and epileptic, and making an appropriation for the same. Section 1. The People of the State of Michigan enact, that there shall be established in this State an institution for the custody, care, education, proper treatment and discipline of feeble-minded and epileptic persons, under the name and the style of the "Michigan Home for the Feeble-minded and Epileptic. . . . Section 20. <b><u>All feeble-minded and epileptic persons between the ages of six</u></b> and twenty-one years who are legal residents of the State of Michigan may be admitted to said home without charge for tuition, boarding, lodging, washing, medicine or medical attendance. In the selection of inmates preference shall be given to indigent or pauper orphans, and <b><u>when this class is provided for such others may be admitted for whom application may be made</u></b>, and as accommodations may be provided for by sufficient buildings. And when these classes are provided for other feeble-minded and epileptic persons who are entitled to admissions may be received at such institution. Section 21. The object of said institution shall be to provide, by all proper and feasible means, the intellectual, moral and physical training of that unfortunate portion of the community who have been born or by disease have become imbecile or feeble-minded or epileptic, and by a judicious and well-adapted course of training and management to ameliorate their condition and to develop as much as possible their intellectual faculties to reclaim them from their unhappy condition and fit them as far as possible for future usefulness in society. . . . Section 26. The superintendents of the poor in each of the counties of the State in which there are or shall be persons of this class eligible to admission to this home by the provisions of this act, who have no contagious disease, and who are, or shall become chargeable to said county, or to any township therein, shall cause all; or any such persons to be taken to the home for the feeble-minded and epileptic and to be taken into the custody and care of said home, in accordance with the rules and regulations of said home. No person, however, shall be admitted to said home, until a certificate of admission has been issued for the admission of said person by some officer of said home duly authorized by the board of trustees to issue such certificate.
